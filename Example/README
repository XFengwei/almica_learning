After sourcing Miriad, you can cd to the /Example/combine directory 
and then execute
> combine.sh

I have converted the calibrated ALMA data to standard FITS format.
Otherwise, the ALMA MS files are too large to be hosted by github.
Those FITS data (including ALMA, ACA, and TP data) are in the directory
/Example/data/fits

Nevertheless, the two scripts
exportfits_Lupus.py
exportfits_TP.py
allow you to see how the ALMA MS data were exported.

The calibrated data were obtained from the workshop
https://www.alma-allegro.nl/data-combination/
that I was a co-organizer.
